## How the Globe Works

The site features a 3D globe rendered with `react-globe.gl`. Country markers are
loaded from [`src/data/visitedCountries.json`](src/data/visitedCountries.json)
and the earth textures are stored in [`public/textures/`](public/textures/).
Dark and light versions of the texture are swapped automatically based on the
current theme.
